 USDT Fork - Studio Blockchain

This is a 1:1 fork of the official Tether USD (USDT) smart contract, deployed on Studio Blockchain.
By mirroring the original audited Tether contract, this fork inherits all the security, stability, and reliability of the industry-standard USDT implementation.

ðŸ”¹ Why This Fork?
âœ… Fully compatible with the original Tether contract
âœ… Retains all security & audit benefits of USDT
âœ… Designed for Studio Blockchain's stablecoin ecosystem
âœ… Supports minting (issue) & burning (redeem) by the contract owner
âœ… Implements blacklisting & pausable features for security

This contract will serve as Studio Blockchainâ€™s native USDT-equivalent stablecoin, with planned cross-chain bridge integration to allow seamless transfers between Studio Blockchain, Ethereum, and other EVM networks.
